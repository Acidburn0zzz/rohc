.SH "NAME"
rohc_decomp_set_prtt \- Set the number of packets sent during one Round-Trip Time (RTT).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_decomp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_decomp_set_prtt\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_decomp *const  decomp\fP,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Set the maximum number of packets sent in worst case by the remote ROHC compressor for one given stream (ie. one compression/decompression context) during one Round\-Trip Time (RTT).
.PP 
The number of packets sent by the remote ROHC compressor is used to estimate how many SN bits those feedbacks shall transmit to avoid any ambiguity at compressor about the ROHC packet that is (n)acknowledged by the decompressor.
.PP 
The pRTT value must be in range [0 ; SIZE_MAX/2[. If set to 0, all SN bits are always transmitted.
.PP 
The default value is 50 packets / RTT, ie. a RTT of 1 second with one packet transmitted every 20 milliseconds (classic VoIP stream). If your network streams and conditions differ, change the default value.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor 
.TP
.B prtt
The number of packets sent during one RTT 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
true if the new value was successfully set, false otherwise
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
struct rohc_decomp *decomp;
_type_t cid_type = ROHC_SMALL_CID;
_t max_cid = ROHC_SMALL_CID_MAX;

/* create the ROHC decompressor in bi\-directional mode */
decomp = rohc_decomp_new2(cid_type, max_cid, ROHC_O_MODE);
if(decomp == NULL)
{
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to create the ROHC decompressor\n");
        goto destroy_comp;
}

        if(!rohc_decomp_set_prtt(decomp, 0))
        {
                fprintf(stderr, "failed to configure decompressor pRTT\n");
                goto destroy_decomp;
        }
