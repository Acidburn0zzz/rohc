.SH "NAME"
rohc_decomp_get_context_info \- Get some information about the given decompression context.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_decomp.h>
.sp
\fBbool rohc_decomp_get_context_info\fP(
    \fBconst struct rohc_decomp *const    decomp\fP,
    \fBconst rohc_cid_t                   cid\fP,
    \fBrohc_decomp_context_info_t *const  info\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Get some information about the given decompression context.
.PP 
To use the function, call it with a pointer on a pre\-allocated rohc_decomp_context_info_t structure with the \fBversion_major\fP and \fBversion_minor\fP fields set to one of the following supported versions:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Major 0, minor 0
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
See rohc_decomp_context_info_t for details about fields that are supported in the above versions.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B decomp
The ROHC decompressor to get information from 
.TP
.B cid
The Context ID to get information for 
.TP
.B info [input, output]
The structure where information will be stored 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "Some information about one decompression context"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
The structure is used by the \fBrohc_decomp_get_context_info\fP function to store some information about one decompression context.
.PP 
Versioning works as follow:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_major\fP field defines the compatibility level. If the major number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, an error is returned.
.PP 
\(bu The \fBversion_minor\fP field defines the extension level. If the minor number given by user does not match the one expected by the library, only the fields supported in that minor version will be filled by \fBrohc_decomp_get_context_info\fP.
.PP 
.RE
.PP 
Notes for developers:
.PP 
.RS
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is removed.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the major version if a field is added at the beginning or in the middle of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu Increase the minor version if a field is added at the very end of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The version_major and version_minor fields must be located at the very beginning of the structure.
.PP 
\(bu The structure must be packed.

\(bu Major 0 / Minor 0 contains: version_major, version_minor, packets_nr, comp_bytes_nr, uncomp_bytes_nr, corrected_crc_failures, corrected_sn_wraparounds, and corrected_wrong_sn_updates.
