.SH "NAME"
rohc_comp_pad \- Pad the given ROHC compressed packet.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <rohc/rohc_comp.h>
.sp
\fBrohc_status_t rohc_comp_pad\fP(
    \fBstruct rohc_comp *const  comp\fP,
    \fBstruct rohc_buf *const   rohc_pkt\fP,
    \fBconst size_t             min_pkt_len\fP
);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Add as many padding bytes as required to get a ROHC packet of the given length.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B comp
The ROHC compressor 
.TP
.B rohc_pkt [input, output]
The compressed ROHC packet to pad up to \fBmin_pkt_len\fP 
.TP
.B min_pkt_len
The minimum length of the ROHC packet 
.SH STRUCTURES
.SS "A network buffer for the ROHC library"
.PP
.sp
.PP 
May represent one uncompressed packet, one ROHC packet, or a ROHC feedback.
.PP 
The network buffer does not contain the packet data itself. It only has a pointer on it. This is designed this way for performance reasons: no copy required to initialize a network buffer, the struct is small and may be passed as copy to function.
.PP 
The network buffer is able to keep some free space at its beginning. The unused space at the beginning of the buffer may be used to prepend a network header at the very end of the packet handling.
.PP 
The beginning of the network buffer may also be shifted forward with the \fBrohc_buf_pull\fP function or shifted backward with the \fBrohc_buf_push\fP function. This is useful when parsing a network packet (once bytes are read, shift them forward) for example.
.PP 
The network buffer may be initialized manually (see below) or with the helper functions \fBrohc_buf_init_empty\fP or \fBrohc_buf_init_full\fP...

struct \fBrohc_buf\fP {
  struct rohc_ts \fItime\fP;    /* The timestamp associated to the data */
  uint8_t       *\fIdata\fP;    /* The buffer data */
  size_t         \fImax_len\fP; /* The maximum length of the buffer */
  size_t         \fIoffset\fP;  /* The offset for the beginning of the data */
  size_t         \fIlen\fP;     /* The data length (in bytes) */
};

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
Possible return values: 
.RS

\(bu \fBROHC_STATUS_OK\fP if a padded ROHC packet is returned 

\(bu \fBROHC_STATUS_OUTPUT_TOO_SMALL\fP if the buffer is too small for the padded ROHC packet 

\(bu \fBROHC_STATUS_ERROR\fP if an error occurred
